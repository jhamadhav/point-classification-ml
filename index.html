        <span class="header">How does it work ? </span> <br> <br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine learning</a> is the study of computer
        algorithms that improves automatically through
        experience.
        <br><br>
        In this case the it is used to separate various points plotted in a region by color. <br> Question remains, how
        does this example works ? <br> <br> It's as follows : <br> </div>

    <br> <br>


    <div class="article">
        <span class="header">Step 1 : </span> <br> <br>
        <div> <img src="./img/step1.png" alt="step 1"></div> <br>
        Initially a circle is drawn, this is the region were the machine will
        operate. <br> Later few ( n = 250) points are randomly
        drawn on the region. The number n is arbitrary and it doesn't affect the results. <br>
        The location of these points is stored in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array">array</a> to later
        feed to the learning algorithm (Let's call it ml for
        now).
    </div>

    <br> <br>

    <div class="article">
        <span class="header">Step 2 : </span> <br> <br>
        <img src="./img/step2.png" alt="step 2"><br> <br>
        A line is randomly draw, let's call it <i>pseudo line</i> and make all the points that are 'left' of it
        <i>Red</i> and all the points on it's 'right' <i>blue</i> or vice-versa.<br>
        Later, this line is discarded and the only thing left is the position and the color of the points present.
    </div>

    <br> <br>

    <div class="article">
        <span class="header">Step 3 : </span> <br> <br>
        <img src="./img/step3.png" alt="step 3"><br><br>
        Once the required points are plotted the <i>pseudo line</i> is removed from the region and only the colored
        points are left. Now it's up to the ml to draw a line and adjust it in such a way that all the colored
        pointes are separated.
    </div>

    <br> <br>

    <div class="article">
        <span class="header">Step 4 : </span> <br> <br>
        <img src="./img/step4.png" alt="step 4"><br><br>
        The ml first draws a random line called <i>'ml_line' </i>(green in color), this line is not related to the
        previous pseudo line and only has information about the points and their respective color. <br> <br>
        <i style="color: #f1c40f;">So how does the machine train ?</i> <br> <br>
        For the ml_line, let's pre-decide that we want all red points on the left and blue on the right or vice-versa.
        <br> <br>
        Next ml will check all the present line. <br> If they are as we decided then it is ignored and if not then it's
        distance is calculated and stored in a variable called <i>'ml_error'</i>
        <div class="br"></div>
        Now we have the distances of all the misplaced points as error, ml will now adjust the line by checking all the
        possible cases by which it can move the line and the one that will produce the least error will be executed.
    </div>

    <br> <br>

    <div class="article">
        <span class="header">Step 5 : </span> <br> <br>
        <img src="./img/step5.png" alt="step 5"><br> <br>
        Once all the points are evaluated and the ml_line is moved, if the error is low enough to be ignored the work is
        done else the no. of generation is increased by one and the process repeats. <br> <br> And finally the task is
        complete, thus rather than having to find a rigid formula or method by hand to find a method to separate these
        points by color, we wrote a algorithm
        that will teach itself to do the specific task by trial and error. <br> <br>
        And that's the rudimentary concept of Machine Learning.
        <br> <br>
        <span class="header">Hence my first Machine Learning project is completed ! :) </span>
